The current project is to make a website that tists recipes of foods.
It will have muultiple web pages, linked to the index (home page).
It will be used for projects for other languages (CSS an JS).
By producing this project, I will have demonstrated my skills to:
Create boilerplate, know different elements and attributes, know how
to link to other webpages, know how to add images and configure them
and I will know how to make paragraphs and headings.
